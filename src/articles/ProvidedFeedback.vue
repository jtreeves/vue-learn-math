            After you answer each question, you'll get feedback on whether or not it was correct. If you got it correct, you'll see a green message. In contrast, if you got it wrong, you'll see a red message.

            If you get it wrong, the app will tell you what the correct answer actually was. You can also look at the borders around the answer choices to double check what you originally inputted. Your original incorrect choice will have a red border, while the correct answer will have a green border.
